# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) – SUT (Fall 2024)
This repository showcases my solutions and implementations of classic **Data Structures and Algorithms**, developed as part of my coursework at **Sharif University of Technology (SUT)** in Semester 3 (Fall 2024).  
They are meant for learning, not for direct copying in other courses.

## 📚 Course Overview
The course covers:
- **Data Structures:** Linked List, Stack, Queue, Heap, Tree, Graph
- **Algorithms:** Divide and Conquer, Randomized Algorithms, BFS, DFS 
- **Advanced Topics:** Disjoint Sets, Red-Black Trees, Shortest Paths

*Note: I don't implement programs for all these topics, I only do for some of them (only our assignments).*

## 🛠️ Programming Languages Used
- **C++** 
- **Python**
- **Java** 

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository:

```bash
git  clone  https://github.com/Amirmohammad-sharbati/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
cd  data-structures-and-algorithms
```
Navigate into the folder of the assignment you want to test, then run the code depending on the language:

### 🐍 Python
``` bash
python3 main.py
```

### 💻 C++
**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o program
./program
```
**Windows (CMD / PowerShell):**
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o program.exe
program.exe
```

### ☕ Java
```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
Replace main.py, main.cpp, or Main.java with the actual file names.
